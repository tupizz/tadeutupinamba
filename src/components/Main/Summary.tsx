          For more than eight years of working with software development, I have
          pursued and successfully build Web Systems, APIs, mobile applications,
          and web applications following software programming best practices,
          design patterns, and industry standards. Iâ€™m really into agile
          methodologies and believe that we need to build and deliver
          incrementally. I feel very comfortable and motivated to lead and help
          software development teams to deliver great products.
