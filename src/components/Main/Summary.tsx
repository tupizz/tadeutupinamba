          My work often centers on designing and building from scratch top-notch
          systems written in JavaScript, Node.js, Golang and MySQL, with a
          strong foundation in diverse technologies like Elasticsearch, AWS
          services, and various front-end frameworks. Fluent in both Portuguese
          and English, I am adept at remote collaboration and thrive in agile
          environments. I also have a passion for continuous learning, as
          evident from my ongoing MBA in Data Analytics & Artificial
          Intelligence and my extensive certifications in backend software
          development and Front-end Engineering. I pride myself on my ability to
          lead software development teams, ensuring timely and quality delivery.
